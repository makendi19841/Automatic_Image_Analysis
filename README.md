# Automatic_Image_Analysis_Labs
This reprository contains lab exercises implemented while taking the Course Automatic Image Analysis at the TU Berlin Computer Vision where I gradually acquired competence for the development of image comprehension processes. Based on the feature extraction, knowledge-based image analysis methods were used in accordance with the computer vision paradigm. The skills I have learned can be used in a wide variety of application areas for automatic image understanding and pattern recognition.
